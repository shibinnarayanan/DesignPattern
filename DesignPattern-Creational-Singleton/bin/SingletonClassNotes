Singleton Class (Singleton pattern)
==========================
It is a class which allows us to create only one object of it.
After the first time if we try to instantiate the Singleton class the new variable also points to first instance created 
It restricts the unnecessary creation of object.

It is not a keyword it is program approach.

Steps to create Singleton class
============================================
1 Declare a static variable for the instance of the singleton class
2 Create private constructor which restrict the creation of new instance of the class
3 Create a static method  which return object of singleton class

A private static variable, holding the only instance of the class.
A private constructor, so it cannot be instantiated anywhere else.
A public static method, to return the single instance of the class.

Advantage of Singleton Class
================================================================
1 Primary purpose is to restrict the object creation to one time only.so it will give
access control to resources for example socket or database connection

2 It save memory since it create only object one time

3 We can use the single object repeatedly as per the requirement .This is the reason
why multithreaded and database applications mostly makes use of singleton class.

For caching,logging ,thread pooling,configuration settings in these cases java uses singleton pattern
